  "Optional integration with cloud-itonami-isic-8291's :disclosure/
  relationship-check op (ADR-2607110400 addendum 4) — cross-references
  whether the assigned adjuster has an undisclosed professional-capacity
  relationship with the matter's counterparty, against 8291's sourced
  relationship-graph data. Calls through 8291's OWN DisclosureGovernor —
  no bypass from this side either. A related, sanctions/PEP-flagged
  target makes 8291's OWN governor escalate for 8291's own human
  reviewer first, so this namespace never peeks at Dossier-LLM's
  un-vetted draft proposal to get an early answer."
